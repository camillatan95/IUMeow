# IUMeow
This is a team project by Camilla, EJ and Jennifer.

Our website IUMeow is a cat sitting platform that helps cat owners find a satisfying cat sitter near them. As an owner of a cat, perhaps you have faced the upsetting situation of having to ask someone to take care of your favorite mouser due to various reasons, such as vacation or work. However, when it comes to cats, most owners desire a delicate approach to handling their cats; this is because cats are sensitive and it takes a long time for them to embrace strangers and/or adapt to a new environment. This website provides a simple and trustworthy system with a special focus on cats for cat lovers within the IU network.

We have built the functions including sign up, login system, password change, upload/show data, search by date and availability, payment, reservation with email, policy, how it works. Implemented by HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL/Postgres, redplanet template base.

The process of this business idea was also fully analyzed from customers to market. It was a valuable experience to design from a simple idea to a almost launchable business(need more research). We need to discuss how to legalize the business and simplify the interaction between sitter and owner from both business and ux experience level. 

Cat sitters can sign up with their profile photo with information, while owners can search available sitters through search function to get the result.
