    <h3 class="text-danger">FOR ALL USERS</h3>

  <h3>Nature of IUMeow and Services:</h3>
  <p>IUMeow is a peer-to-peer service participating in the goals of the sharing economy. In this model, users create truthful and complete user profiles to designate cat-sitting abilities and preferences. These profiles are made public so that cat-owners may freely and easily browse all uploaded profiles and access any content uploaded by cat-sitting users. Cat-owners request reservations for individual cat-sitters, and agree to submit full payment via IUMeow’s pre-selected PayPal checkout system. All payments must be made in full within the appropriate timeframe agreed upon by IUMeow creators.
